# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple front-end Tic Tac Toe application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells of the grid.

4. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
